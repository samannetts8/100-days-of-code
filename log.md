# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: November 6, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed Week 6 of Harvard's CS50x and completed the assignments required by the course

**Thoughts:** This was a very useful introduction to Python conceptually, and I learnt a lot about the conceptual uses for this language in app development and I could further extend the applications of my accrued HTML, CSS and Javascript knowledge.


### Day 1: November 7, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed the learning portion of the HTML Foundations module in my School of Code pre-bootcamp learning tasks. I will start the TOP project tomorrow to complete the section.

**Thoughts:** This section does appear reasonably straightforward, though I attribute that more to well layed out modules and exercises than my individual ability!

### Day 2: November 8, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Started the odin_recipes project creating a set of recipe websites to develop fundamental HTML, Javascript and CSS skills. For this, I created the first index.html file, related asset folders and subsequent recipe sites.

**Thoughts**: Establishing the basic set up of index.html and linking the new websites was straightforward. It was good practice getting familiar with constructing the elements and links.

### Day 3: November 9, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed Week 7 of Harvard's CS50x and completed the assignments required by the course

**Thoughts:** This was a very great SQL introduction which I think will be pivotal in establishing my skillset with respect to back-end operations for any future projects I do! I can't say I figured out the answer to the Fiftyville however....

### Day 4: November 10, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed the CSS Foundations module as part of my School of Code pre-bootcamp learning tasks.

**Thoughts**: Whilst I understood the fundamentals of the Box Model and how to interact with margins, padding and borders, I struggled slightly when it came requested exercises. I was able to complete them eventually, and it is my hope that I get much more comfortable with these as I toy with it over time. 

### Day 5: November 11, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Attempted basic CSS formatting by laying out the recipe links in a grid formation

**Thoughts:** This was a useful exercise as it familiarised myself more with different psuedoclasses and taught me more about using HTML containers more flexibily
