# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: November 6, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed Week 6 of Harvard's CS50x and completed the assignments required by the course

**Thoughts:** This was a very useful introduction to Python conceptually, and I learnt a lot about the conceptual uses for this language in app development and I could further extend the applications of my accrued HTML, CSS and Javascript knowledge.


### Day 2: November 7, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed the learning portion of the HTML Foundations module in my School of Code pre-bootcamp learning tasks. I will start the TOP project tomorrow to complete the section.

**Thoughts:** This section does appear reasonably straightforward, though I attribute that more to well layed out modules and exercises than my individual ability!

### Day 3: November 8, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Started the odin_recipes project creating a set of recipe websites to develop fundamental HTML, Javascript and CSS skills. For this, I created the first index.html file, related asset folders and subsequent recipe sites.

**Thoughts**: Establishing the basic set up of index.html and linking the new websites was straightforward. It was good practice getting familiar with constructing the elements and links.

### Day 4: November 9, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed Week 7 of Harvard's CS50x and completed the assignments required by the course

**Thoughts:** This was a very great SQL introduction which I think will be pivotal in establishing my skillset with respect to back-end operations for any future projects I do! I can't say I figured out the answer to the Fiftyville however....

### Day 5: November 10, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Completed the CSS Foundations module as part of my School of Code pre-bootcamp learning tasks.

**Thoughts**: Whilst I understood the fundamentals of the Box Model and how to interact with margins, padding and borders, I struggled slightly when it came requested exercises. I was able to complete them eventually, and it is my hope that I get much more comfortable with these as I toy with it over time. 

### Day 6: November 11, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Attempted basic CSS formatting by laying out the recipe links in a grid formation

**Thoughts:** This was a useful exercise as it familiarised myself more with different psuedoclasses and taught me more about using HTML containers more flexibily. I believe I have met the basic requirements for completing the project at this point.

### Day 7: November 12, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Began working through the modules and exercises as part of the JavaScript basic SoC learning module

**Thoughts:** Given the previous weeks of CS50 that I have completed, I am relatively comfortable with the ideas and practices discussed in this section. However, debugging is something that I still need to practice and develop my skills in. I see this is in the next section and so I look forward to this section in particular!

### Day 8: November 13, 2024

**Today's Progress**: I completed the remaining elements of the Javascript basics module in the SoC course prelearning module. 

**Thoughts:** As expected, I was not familiar with the try...catch... habit so this was definitely useful to learn! I will certainly be going back over this section prior to starting the course!

### Day 9: November 14, 2024

**Today's Progress**: To continue my HTML, CSS and Javascript development, I have started the educative.io programme 'Learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript from Scratch' to cement my previous learnings

**Thoughts:** The interative exercises and problems scattered throughout the programme so far certainly helped me apply the theory that is layed out in the course, and I have covered some further materials such as HTML Tables and Forms.

### Day 10: November 15, 2024

**Today's Progress**: I returned to the odin_recipe project to test my comfort applying CSS formatting to the HTML file further. This was primarily done through creating an animated pulsing background and adjusting margins for improved aesthetics. 

**Thoughts:** Building this animated background was certainly the most challenging thing I have done so far in the process, specifically regarding how to make the colour shift more fluid whilst still using a linear gradient and how to stack the background element amongst the other HTML elements on the page using z-levels. It was definitely difficult at times, but it eventually came together!

### Day 11: November 16, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Began to integrate JS code into my odin_recipe project through implementing an 'Enter' button and having timed animations proceed this event. I also learnt a lot more CSS Inline vs Inline-Block vs Block coding and resultingly adjusted a few elements from <p> classes to <span> classes. 

**Thoughts:** This was a super interesting exercise in testing both my creativity and logical problem solving which I really enjoyed. I'm really happy with the result and, whilst there is still a lot to improve, I'm happy with the difference in the look and feel of the 'website' from the start of the day to the end.

### Day 12: November 17, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Reached a logical end point on my odin_recipe project after finishing the formatting on my subsequent recipe page sites, including the use of flex displays to organise the img, ingredients list and recipe steps elements through selective use of containers

**Thoughts:** Again, I learnt even more about how to actually apply inline vs block styles for elements in this process, and I am very happy with how the site looks in the end. I may come back to try and add further JS animations in an attempt to develop these skills, but I may also take on a new project instead.

### Day 13: November 18, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Continued working through the educative.io programme 'Learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript from Scratch' where I gained a greater understanding of how to implement Javascript into HTML files - specifically, I practiced interacting with a range of different event listeners.

**Thoughts:** This has been a really useful exercise of revising what I learnt throughout the SoC learning materials for a few reasons: 1) It covers the same ideas in different words, meaning I could have areas of lesser confidence explained in a different way, 2) It provides small coding challenges and exercises as I go through to make sure the information doesn't remain as theory and 3) covers different elements such as buttons, semantic tags and forms which weren't directly covered in the SoC materials.
